      <h2>Byron Keyes</h2>

      <p>Hello my name is Byron Keyes I come from working in call center environments. Most recently at Nationwide in the claims intake department. I have wanted to learn to code since it was described to me as having a super power. I found out about coding bootcamps in 2016 and I attended my first class at DeltaV and loved it. I have worked on many different teams with many different people and have always found a way to be a team player and have success.<br></p>

      <p>Before I began at DeltaV I worked in the automotive field and then at Quaker. I believe my previous experience diagnosing problems in the automotive field will serve as a beneficial skill set for me in this field. I hope to eventually use the knowledge I acquire to work for myself.<br></p>
