## Project Pitch

### Project Name: DeltaDex

### DeltaDex Idea Summary

* High Level: This app is somewhere a player would go for information about the game, kind of like a game guide. 
* Detail: Some of the things in a typical game guide: What level does this Pokemon evolve, what is its typing, strong and weak points, etc. 
* Scope: There are more than 850 Pokemon so it is difficult, even for active players, to remember all the information they need to play the game. 
* User profile: This is a resource for casual and advanced players. This is a comprehensive resource. 
* Database: The database tracks the Pokemon you have added to your team of six.  We will add a button that someone can toggle on/off to indicate which Pokemon are on their team. 
* API: https://pokeapi.co/
An open RESTful API for Pok√©mon data


## MVP Definition

* Index page with original set of 150 Pokemon, loading with all thumbnails, name, type. 
* Details page will load additional fields after the user clicks through on one of the thumbnails from index. 
* Database will save all 150 on initial API load - in case API is not functioning.
* Other pages include static page: About Me (Team members and pitches; contact info)
