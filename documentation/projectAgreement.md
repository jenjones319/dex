# Group Project: Team Agreement: Jen Jones, Byron Keyes, Arik Mackenburg, Drew Scott

* You will be required to make a Team agreement. This will be used as the baseline and structure requirements for how your team will run during project week.

* Review and write out your plan for the following. Be sure to label each section explicitly.

## Communication plan 

### How will your group communicate with each other? 

* We will slack one another in our project channel. Not in zoom messaging or Remo messaging. Slack is where all written communication will take place, aside from the GitHub project tab.

* A project has been created in GitHub, attached to the repo.  This is where we will add tasks and track the progress on each. More detail on this is in work plan below. 

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?

* Morning stand-up and afternoon stand-up meetings every day, in Remo. Morning one right after whole class zoom (9:10 am-ish, 1 pm, and 3 pm if needed). See conflict plan and work plan for more details.

* Our approved project plan that was submitted to our instructors will guide our final deliverable. It can/will be revised as we go along, as needed, to ensure MVP is met for our final project. If any changes need to be made to MVP, we will vote on this change and each person gets one vote. 

## Conflict plan

### What will your group do when it encounters conflict? 

* Every group member will be working on a task defined within the project in GitHub, and will check out a branch that reflects the name of that task. 
* If conflicts occur regarding who is working on what, the source of truth is the GitHub project. 
* You must look at that project tab in GitHub and assign tasks to yourself by adding your name to that task in GitHub. 
* Two persons should not have conflicting drafts of code on as it should be assigned to one person in the GitHub project.

### What will your process be to resolve it?

* If we are having a conflict regarding what functionality to add or remove, any group member can call for a vote at any time, and that vote is binding. 

* If we are having a work style conflict among group members, we will involve an instructor as early as possible. 

## Work plan 

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? 

* We have a scrum master (Drew), who will set up our morning and afternoon stand-up meetings.  He will also check the project board to ensure that tasks are in the right column (To-do, In-Progress, Complete, Parking Lot).

* If there are issues or tasks that are not fully formed or have group agreement, Drew will present to Keith. If it is an interpersonal or work-style conflict any group member can go to an instructor at any time, they do not need to talk to the Scrum Master first.  

### In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. 

* We have a scrum master (Drew), who will set up our morning and afternoon stand-up meetings.  He will also check the project board to ensure that tasks are in the right column (To-do, In-Progress, Complete, Parking Lot), he will also invite one of our instructors in for one afternoon stand-up each day to ensure project work equity among everyone, that everyone is doing their equal part on the hard work. 

### What project management tool will be used?

* GitHub project tab inside the dex repo in GitHub is where tasks will be managed. 

* Every group member will be working on a task defined within the project in GitHub, and will check out a branch that reflects the name of that task. When we switch tasks, we switch branches. 

* We have a scrum master (Drew), who will set up our morning and afternoon stand-up meetings.  He will also check the project board to ensure that tasks are in the right column (To-do, In-Progress, Complete, Parking Lot), he will also invite one of our instructors in for one afternoon stand-up each day to ensure project work equity among everyone, that everyone is doing their equal part on the hard work. 

## Git process

### What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

* All group members are contributors on one repo (named: dex) and project. 
* All members cloned down the git repo. 
* One person reviews and merges all PRs (Arik). 
* Arik will notify all group members in Slack when people need to do a git pull. 
* Every time a group member makes a pull request, they will notify Arik in Slack so he can review it. 

## Any thing else you feel is important 

* Work times are 9-5, lunch from 12-1. Stand-ups are 9 am (ish); 1 pm; and 3 pm (if Scrum Master thinks it's needed).
* MVP plan is the source of truth for what we're delivering, see above on how it can be modified.
* Drew is the Scrum Master, Arik is GitHub Repo Manager. 
* GitHub Project has our task boards and project documentation (see documentation folder), Slack is official communication, Remo is where meetings take place. 
* This document is in draft form as of 11 am, the group can recommend changes until 4 pm on 8/10/20. At that time, it will be considered final. 
* Jen will submit the daily assignment in canvas on behalf of the entire team by 4 pm each day.
