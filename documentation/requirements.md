Functional Requirements
List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

Adding accounts or user profiles is a future enhancement for this app. 
Users can browse through all vehicles using a partial nav added to the details page. 
A user can search the API by model or name of vehicle. 

Data Flow
The user lands on the main search page with a text box and radio buttons. They choose either name or model of a Star Wars Vehicle then click the Search button.  On click, the event listener works with the event and route handlers to query and retrieve results via the swapi (StarWars API). From there, the handlers also get the corresponding image from the database and present the results to the user via the results.ejs page. 

Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)
Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

Security
Usability
Testability
etc….

Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
