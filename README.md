# Project Name: Pokedex

## Project Team Members: Jennifer Jones, Byron Keyes, Arik Mackenburg, Drew Scott

### Purpose of the Project: 

* This app is a resource for a player to use to find information about Pokemon, kind of like a game guide. This app is geared toward users who are playing electronically, not with physical cards. Some of the things in a typical game guide: What level does this Pokemon evolve, what is its typing, strong and weak points, etc. 

* There are more than 850 Pokemon so it is difficult even for active players to remember all the information they need to play the game. This is a resource for casual and advanced players. This is a comprehensive resource. The database tracks Pokemon you have added to your team of six.  In app will feature a button that a user can toggle on/off to indicate which Pokemon are on their team. 

* API: https://pokeapi.co/ -- An open RESTful API for Pok√©mon data.
